# minimal.css

minimal.css is an easy to use, invasive, and simple minimal css framework. Unlike other minimal frameworks, minimal.css may seem quite large, but is extremely feature rich, with new features being implemented daily. If a large framework like Bootstrap is too heavy for your needs, while a small framework like Skeleton CSS is too basic, minimal.css may be perfect for you. It is fully modular, allowing the user to remove and add components as desired. Each component is completely extensible and configurable, with nearly every value as a Sass variable. This README is based on the orignial minimal.css README, without the Building section

## A Warning to the User

minimal.css is a new creation, and currently under heavy development. Be warned that it is far from complete, and is subject to change often. It is licensed under AGPLv3, so USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. Bugs may occur throughout, and please report them on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/HereIsKevin/minimal.css/issues), so that they may be fixed.

## Using

To use minimal.css, copy `minimal.css` and `minimal.js` to wherever needed, and add this to your file's `<head>` include them in your files, replacing the `/path/to/`s with the actual path of the files:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/path/to/minimal.css">
<script type="text/javascript" src="/path/to/minimal.js"></script>
```

In production, it is preferable to use a minified version, so replace copy the `minimal.min.css` and `minimal.min.js` instead to wherever needed, and add this instead to your file's `<head>` to include them in your files, again replacing the `/path/to/`s with the actual path of the files:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/path/to/minimal.min.css">
<script type="text/javascript" src="/path/to/minimal.min.js"></script>
```

If you want support for Internet Explorer, use minimal_for_ie.js for developement and minimal_for_ie.min.js for production instead.

## Issues

Bugs are common, so please report them on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/HereIsKevin/minimal.css/issues).

## Licensing

I believe that a work of open source should stay open, along with all the contributions to the code, as improvements should always be shared, so I decided to license this project under AGPLv3, which you can see the restrictions [here](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/agpl-3.0/).
